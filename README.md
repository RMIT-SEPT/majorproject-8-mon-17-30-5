## HOW TO SET UP

To set up the frontend, copy all the files in the frontend into another folder and delete frontend for the time being, 
there needs to be no frontend folder in order to create the react application using vs-code.

Make sure you've downloaded nodejs and set up react according to tutorial, once you have done that go to the root folder in the code and run.

npx create-react-app frontend

this will create the frontend folder and app with nothing in it, once this has run, check it runs by running

cd frontend
npm start

React should open and run, this is good.

After you have done this, copy our source code into the react folder. And you should be good to go.
